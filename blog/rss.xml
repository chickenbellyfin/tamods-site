            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who regularly play, particularly on the community servers, you may have noticed a couple of TAMods updates recently (versions 1.17 and 1.18).</p><p>These (and some accompanying updates to the serverside TAMods and the community login servers) have mostly included fixes /u/Griffon27 has written that should improve the stability of the game when playing with TAMods and playing on custom servers.</p><p>Just to give a bit of visibility into what&#x27;s improved, I&#x27;m posting a list of the major changes.</p><h2>Changes</h2><ul><li>Implemented serverside match end / summary screen, making the summary work for players not using clientside TAMods (plus giving you info about other players!) and fixing a common &#x27;crash on map end&#x27; issue</li><li>Fix consistent issue where TAMods would cause the game client to freeze/crash when quitting</li><li>Fix for client crashes when running server commands on custom servers</li></ul><p>This goes along with some fixes made further back that I don&#x27;t think we ever announced:</p><ul><li>Fix for server crash when a vehicle is destroyed shortly after its pilot exits the vehicle</li><li>Fix for crashes when selecting loadouts from numpad in OOTB</li></ul><p>It&#x27;s not exciting new features but hopefully these make the experience of playing with TAMods and on community servers a bit smoother!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A new major version of TAMods, version 0.7, has now been released and is available via the TribesLauncher application.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new major version of TAMods, version 0.7, has now been released and is available via <a href="https://github.com/mcoot/TribesLauncher/releases">the TribesLauncher application</a>.</p><p>Read on for a list of major changes, read on!</p><h2>Changes</h2><h3>Weapon Model Customisation</h3><p>Do you miss the SAP20? Well, it&#x27;s back - or its weapon model is, at least! You can now swap the first person weapon model of any weapon out for that of any other - including models of the weapons removed in the Out of the Blue update. This can be done via the external configuration tool, the Ubermenu or via the <code>setWeaponModel</code> Lua function.</p><p>Note that this system isn&#x27;t quite perfect yet. First, updating model swaps while the game is running often does not work correctly, requiring a relaunch to apply. Second, some weapon animations do not transition correctly, causing the model to be held or animated wrong; this is most noticeable when swapping weapons with others of very different kinds (e.g. a sniper rifle for a pistol). Finally, there are <em>very</em> rare crashes associated with the weapon swapping subsystem, generally occurring when the game ends.</p><h3>Stats Recording</h3><p>TAMods can now record game statistics and give you a summary at the end of a match. With the <code>recordStats</code> option enabled, you will now see a printout of your player statistics for the match, including everything from your fastest grab speed to that all important K/D ratio.</p><p>The <code>recordTeamStats</code> option will also print out information about the whole game - the map, who won, and the names of the players on each time.</p><p>Both kinds of statistics can also optionally be logged out to a file (in your T:A config directory) by enabling the <code>saveStats</code> and <code>saveTeamStats</code> options.</p><h3>New HUDModules</h3><p>The following HUDModules have been added and are now available in the Ubermenu HUD Maker:</p><ul><li><code>dodgeKillFeed</code></li><li><code>dodgeScoreboard</code></li><li><code>dodgeSpeedBar</code></li><li><code>indiIFF Healthbars</code> - alternate healthbars which show the percentage health of players</li><li><code>mcootKillNotifications</code> - an alternate way of displaying player kills, more similar to that of other FPS games</li><li><code>mcootRabbitScoreboard</code></li><li><code>mcootSpeedbars</code></li><li><code>mcootStats</code> - an extension of the <code>sqStats</code> module which shows information including your current kill streak count</li><li><code>mcootVehicleHealthEnergy</code></li></ul><h3>Developer Documentation</h3><p>A major change in this release is the comprehensive reference for the TAMods API on this website, accompanied by short tutorials for writing your first TAMods scripts.</p><h3>Minor API Improvements</h3><p>A number of new minor features have been added to the Lua API:</p><h4>Convenience constants</h4><p>Constant values / enums used throughout the Lua API have been given named constants accessible under the <code>enums</code> namespace. Enums have been added for the following kinds of values:</p><ul><li>Team Number</li><li>Equip Points</li><li>Reticule Types</li><li>Chat Channels</li><li>Input Eventtypes</li><li>Kill Types</li><li>Text Alignments</li></ul><h4>New Functions</h4><p>The following functions have been added to the API:</p><ul><li><code>getHud()</code> - returns a reference to the HUD object, previously accessible only within certain events</li><li><code>drawUTTextScaled()</code> - allows the drawing of text in Unreal Tournament fonts with bitmap scaling applied</li><li><code>player.isSkiing()</code> - returns whether the player is currently skiing</li><li><code>vehicle.name()</code> - Get the name of the vehicle the player is in</li><li><code>vehicle.seatName()</code> - Get the name of the current seat of the vehicle the player is in</li><li><code>vehicle.seatIndex()</code> - Get the index of the seat of the vehicle the player is in</li><li><code>vehicle.seatCount()</code> - Get the number of seats in the vehicle the player is in</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
