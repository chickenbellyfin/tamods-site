and is available via [the TribesLauncher application](https://github.com/mcoot/TribesLauncher/releases).\\r\\n\\r\\nRead on for a list of major changes, read on!\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n### Weapon Model Customisation\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you miss the SAP20? Well, it\'s back - or its weapon model is, at least! You can now swap the first person weapon model of any weapon out for that of any other - including models of the weapons removed in the Out of the Blue update. This can be done via the external configuration tool, the Ubermenu or via the `setWeaponModel` Lua function.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that this system isn\'t quite perfect yet. First, updating model swaps while the game is running often does not work correctly, requiring a relaunch to apply. Second, some weapon animations do not transition correctly, causing the model to be held or animated wrong; this is most noticeable when swapping weapons with others of very different kinds (e.g. a sniper rifle for a pistol). Finally, there are _very_ rare crashes associated with the weapon swapping subsystem, generally occurring when the game ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Stats Recording\\r\\n\\r\\nTAMods can now record game statistics and give you a summary at the end of a match. With the `recordStats` option enabled, you will now see a printout of your player statistics for the match, including everything from your fastest grab speed to that all important K/D ratio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `recordTeamStats` option will also print out information about the whole game - the map, who won, and the names of the players on each time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth kinds of statistics can also optionally be logged out to a file (in your T:A config directory) by enabling the `saveStats` and `saveTeamStats` options.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New HUDModules\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following HUDModules have been added and are now available in the Ubermenu HUD Maker:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `dodgeKillFeed`\\r\\n- `dodgeScoreboard`\\r\\n- `dodgeSpeedBar`\\r\\n- `indiIFF Healthbars` - alternate healthbars which show the percentage health of players\\r\\n- `mcootKillNotifications` - an alternate way of displaying player kills, more similar to that of other FPS games\\r\\n- `mcootRabbitScoreboard`\\r\\n- `mcootSpeedbars`\\r\\n- `mcootStats` - an extension of the `sqStats` module which shows information including your current kill streak count\\r\\n- `mcootVehicleHealthEnergy`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Developer Documentation\\r\\n\\r\\nA major change in this release is the comprehensive reference for the TAMods API on this website, accompanied by short tutorials for writing your first TAMods scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Minor API Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of new minor features have been added to the Lua API:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Convenience constants\\r\\n\\r\\nConstant values / enums used throughout the Lua API have been given named constants accessible under the `enums` namespace. Enums have been added for the following kinds of values:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Team Number\\r\\n- Equip Points\\r\\n- Reticule Types\\r\\n- Chat Channels\\r\\n- Input Eventtypes\\r\\n- Kill Types\\r\\n- Text Alignments\\r\\n\\r\\n#### New Functions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following functions have been added to the API:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `getHud()` - returns a reference to the HUD object, previously accessible only within certain events\\r\\n- `drawUTTextScaled()` - allows the drawing of text in Unreal Tournament fonts with bitmap scaling applied\\r\\n- `player.isSkiing()` - returns whether the player is currently skiing\\r\\n- `vehicle.name()` - Get the name of the vehicle the player is in\\r\\n- `vehicle.seatName()` - Get the name of the current seat of the vehicle the player is in\\r\\n- `vehicle.seatIndex()` - Get the index of the seat of the vehicle the player is in\\r\\n- `vehicle.seatCount()` - Get the number of seats in the vehicle the player is in"}]}')}}]);
