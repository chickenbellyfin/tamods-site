## Models

TAMods allows you to swap the first person weapon models of weapons with others, including those of weapons removed from the game.

Weapon model swapping will only affect the first person view.

## Projectiles

TAMods allows you to modify and swap the projectile particle systems of weapons, including swapping to projectiles removed from the game.

Projectile swapping/modification will only affect _your_ projectiles, not those of other players.
